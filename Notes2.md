# If we have the same API request with the same path,the FastAPI goes down the code and searches for the first match with respect to the API request parameters...

# And hence,the order does matter when hitting the same paths in an URL...since,the first path that matches the API request runs first.

Eg. request Get method url: "/" made then it searches for the first match with respect to the API request parameters and returns the first match.
